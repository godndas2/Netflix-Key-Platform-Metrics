# Netflix-Key-Platform-Metrics

Assumptions

- Total number of daily active users = 100 million
- The peak daily active users, 100 million * 3 = 300 million
- The max peak daily active users in 3 months, 300 million * 2 = 600 million
- The average number of videos watched by each user per day = 5
- The average size of one video = 500 MB
- The average number of videos uploaded per day from the backend = 1,000
- Total number of videos watched per day = 100 million *5 =500 million
- Total peak video per day = 1.5 billion
- Total max peak video per day = 3 billion
- Total egress per day = 500 million * 500 MB = 250 PB (Peta Byte)
- Egress bandwidth = 29.1GB/sec
- Total ingress for upload = 1,000 * 500MB = 500GB
- Ingress bandwidth =5.8MB/sec
- Total Storage required in 5 years = 500 GB*5*365 = 912.5TB ï¼ˆplease note that Netflix creates multiple formats and resolutions for each video optimized for different device types. So the storage will be more than 912.5TB.
